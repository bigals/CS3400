Suppose you have a web application in /somewhere. Add a virtual host to your Apache configuration file and set its DocumentRoot to /somewhere/public:

<VirtualHost *:60722>
	ServerName vps.cs.wmich.edu
	# !!! Be sure to point DocumentRoot to 'public'!
	DocumentRoot ~/Githubmanager/public
	# This needs to be used until you setup a production secret key
	RailsEnv development
	<Directory  ~/Githubmanager/public>
		# This relaxes Apache security settings.
		AllowOverride all
		# MultiViews must be turned off.
		Options -MultiViews
		# Uncomment this is you're on Apache >= 2.4:
		#Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

And that's it! You may also want to check the Users Guide for security and optimization tips, troubleshooting and other usefull information:

                                Cross-site Scripting, XSS, is one of the most common JavaScript vulnerabilities, and is the process of manipulating 
                                websites to return malicious code that will render on the client-side, in a manner that is determined by the 
                                attacker. Cross-site Request Forgery, CSRF, allows attackers to manipulate browsers to take unintended actions on 
                                other sites of the attackers choosing.

                        <p>
                            Embedded Browsers are pieces of software, which provide mobile apps the ability to invoke a browser, in the page. 
                            Embedded Browsers are the only way that mobile platforms allow the user to interact with the browser. Desktop 
                            applications can also use embedded browsers as long as the target platform is supported by the embedded browser that is 
                            being used. Through the use of Embedded Browsers, both mobile applications, as well as desktop applications can render 
                            HTML, CSS, as well as execute JavaScript, while still retaing the structure of a platform specific application around 
                            the browser. It should be noted however, that all Embedded Browsers are platform specific, but most standard browsers, 
                            such as chrome, or firefox have support for multiple platforms.
